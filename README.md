The objective of analyzing this dataset was to develop a model that predicts the stability of an electrical grid based on various input parameters. The main aim was to identify relationships between different factors such as duration, generated power, or steam turbine response, and the stability of the electrical grid. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the goal was to find patterns that could aid in predicting whether a specific grid configuration would be stable or not. The ultimate aim was to understand how different factors influence grid stability, which could be valuable in energy network management and optimization.
